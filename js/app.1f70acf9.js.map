<li><strong>需要预检的请求</strong></li>\r\n    <li><strong>附带身份凭证的请求</strong></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>这三种模式从上到下层层递进，请求可以做的事越来越多，要求也越来越严格。</p><p>下面分别说明三种请求模式的具体规范。</p><h1

<p>实际上，这两个值对于客户端<code>http://my.com</code>而言，都一样，因为客户端才不会管其他源服务器允不允许，就关心自己是否被允许</p><p>当然，服务器也可以维护一个可被允许的源列表，如果请求的<code>Origin</code>命中该列表，才响应<code>*</code>或具体的源</p><p><strong>为了避免后续的麻烦，强烈推荐响应具体的源</strong></p></blockquote>\r\n
